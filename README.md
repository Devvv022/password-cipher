# Password Protection System using Cipher–Decipher Technique

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple password protection system using a basic
Caesar Cipher technique. The goal is to show secure thinking and clear logic
rather than complex cryptography.

## Encryption Logic
Each character of the password is converted to its ASCII value and shifted
forward by a fixed key.

## Decryption Logic
The encrypted characters are shifted backward using the same key to retrieve
the original password.

## Note
This implementation is for educational purposes only and is not recommended
for real-world password storage.# password-cipher
